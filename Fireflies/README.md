# Fireflies - A Music Video

## Description
Created a music video for the song “Fireflies” by Owl City on Unreal Engine 5 by controlling lighting and actors in scenes using keyframes. Used sequence animations, track recorders, and Blueprints to perform scene transitions. Built the environments from scratch by assembling assets, creating textures and landscapes, and modifying materials.
