# Unreal Instrument

## Description
Created a first-person musical instrument experience on Unreal Engine 5 where the player is able to shoot on objects and use keystrokes to produce their own music in a Cyberpunk environment. Made use of collisions to trigger events which produce background music and spatialized audio with visual effects indicating when and where the collision occurred.
