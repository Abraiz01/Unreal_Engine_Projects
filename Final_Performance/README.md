# Toys Got Moves

## Description
Designed a short creative play on Unreal Engine 5 by rigging and animating 3D toy characters. Built the room interior (using lighting, meshes, and materials) and utilized Blueprints to spawn characters on keypress. Programmed more keystrokes to start/stop music and voiceovers in order to perform live. The project was featured in a public show at the NYU Tisch School of the Arts in New York City where I performed the play live in front of an audience.
